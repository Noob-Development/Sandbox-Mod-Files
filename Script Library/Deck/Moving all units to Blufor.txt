While all of these scripts can work independently to edit one feature, only the process of moving every unit to Blufor requires multiple files because of the way I wrote the scripts. Though not all files are absolutely required, these are the ones I have used:

AllCountriesNato
AllCountryArmoriesNato
CoalitionCompositions(NatoOnly)
Nationalite
OtanUnitIds
FlagReferences
FlagSize
